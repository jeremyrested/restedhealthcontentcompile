Here are your guidelines:\n\n1. **Choose wisely**: When you’re getting close to bedtime, select snacks that are whole foods. Make sure to include some protein because lack of protein can also impair sleep. Try your best to cut sugar during the day, or at a minimum, time it earlier in the day. \n2. **No snacks before bed**: Try your best to stop eating about 3 hours before you go to bed. At a minimum, make sure you only eat light snacks during that period. This will give your digestive system time to break down those good eats before you hit the hay.\n\n\n","Top Image":"Appimage–17(1).jpg","JourneyCard":["rec1ZGC8Ii9HcPKtC"],"JourneyCardIds":["rec1ZGC8Ii9HcPKtC"],"id":"rec00ENJ5fRPYUpJM"},"rec00VH7SYrKkZ6lj":{"Name":"intake 1.8","JourneyCard":["rec5qpCf2YXY7hGvN"],"Quiz":["rec9MckiuLkXoM0KV"],"JourneyCardIds":["rec5qpCf2YXY7hGvN"],"id":"rec00VH7SYrKkZ6lj"},"rec0Ac8cxGbMH6GqT":{"Name":"Quickwin 1.1","Bottom Body":"It's time for another Quick Win! \n\nIn case you forgot, Quick Wins will appear throughout your journeys.

This is because your body is working hard when you eat late!\n\n**How to eat on time**\nSkipping breakfast, eating large meals late at night, and fasting can all be disruptive to your circadian rhythm. However, everyone is unique. As always, you should do what works best for you. \n\nHowever, if you are experiencing circadian rhythm disruption, eating breakfast at the same time every morning can help to optimize your circadian rhythm. \n\n**Stay regular**\nThe most important factor with diet and sleep is to remain fairly consistent in your meal times so that your natural rhythms aren’t disrupted. Your body loves to be able to predict your schedule and functions best when things are consistent. \n\n","Top Image":"Appimage–226.jpg","JourneyCard":["rec1ZGC8Ii9HcPKtC"],"JourneyCardIds":["rec1ZGC8Ii9HcPKtC"],"id":"rec3wy44WKNmwYIam"},"rec43acaFjh3b28Ad":{"Name":"actionplanweek2 2.2","JourneyCard":["recJU52pBDJJaGAbC"],"Quiz":["recdCjyt2nj13BsWE"],"JourneyCardIds":["recJU52pBDJJaGAbC"],"id":"rec43acaFjh3b28Ad"},"rec46ZSKTZ8JZDzbE":{"Name":"fa 1.1","Bottom Body":"Having difficulties falling asleep can be incredibly frustrating.

We'll cover this topic more in-depth in the next section.\n\n**TEMPERATURE:** Your body temperature fluctuates throughout the day to sync with your sleep-wake cycle. Your body temperature begins dropping toward the night as your body releases melatonin for sleep. Sleeping in a cool room at night can help induce better sleep by increasing melatonin production. \n\n**EATING**: Eating is an important cue for your circadian rhythm and eating at unusual times can be disruptive. The relationship between the timing of meals and your circadian rhythm is primarily controlled by insulin. This week, we'll show you how to eat to optimize your rhythm in the section on diet and sleep.\n\n**ACTIVITY:** The time of day you exercise and do other activities can have a direct impact on your circadian rhythm. Exercise can even be used to adjust your circadian rhythm forwards or backwards. We'll talk about how you can strategically use physical activity to optimize your rhythm and boost your sleep in the section on exercise and sleep. \n\n**Change takes time**\nKnowing how to identify when your circadian rhythm is healthy and when things have gone askew can help you make healthy decisions to optimize its function.

It is possible to hydrate your way to better sleep!**\n\nHere are our basic tips to help:\n\n- **Choose water**: Avoid drinking too much caffeine, alcohol, or sugary beverages as they are known to cause sleep disturbances. Choose clean tap water, filtered water, or one of many delicious sparkling waters on the market. \n\n- **Balance your diet**: Fruits and vegetables have a high moisture content which can increase your water intake. Watermelon, for example, is 92% water. So, eat your fruits and veggies! \n\n- **Monitor your intake**: Try using a large jug or drinking vessel that has markers to let you know how much you've drunk each day. Most experts recommend around  15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women. \n\nAs always, the amount of water that's right for you will depend on your body composition, needs, and activities each day!

These programs tend to have a pretty big impact on how you sleep. \n\n**How do we learn behaviors?**\nFor the most part, we rarely think about how we learn behaviors that we do every day. That's because our brains are very good at building automatic programming. \n\nThere are two basic types of learning in human behavior:\n1. **Classical conditioning**- Learning by association! It's a passive form of learning where you are building an association between a previously neutral stimulus (ice cream truck music) with a naturally existing stimulus (the yummy taste of ice cream). The result? Hear ice cream truck music and crave ice cream! (there may also be a little salivation involved). \n2. **Operant conditioning**- The strength of a behavior is modified by reward or punishment. For instance, making your bed in the morning makes you feel accomplished – so you're more likely to keep doing it. Also, eating ice cream tastes good so you're more likely to chase down the ice cream man and give him your coins. \n\nEven though we don't always think about how we learn, we are constantly reacting to environmental cues and engaging in behaviors due to these programs. \n\nGoing back to the basics is one of the key ways that psychologists help people modify their behaviors and reprogram their minds and body's to react in healthier ways! \n\n**Learning and sleep**\nA lot of sleep issues are actually caused by passive learning (e.g. classical conditioning).

Six high-quality hours of sleep is better than ten poor quality hours.

Catching up on missed sleep**\n\nA very common myth about sleep is that we should and can make up for missed sleep on subsequent nights. This is false! Trying to make up for lost sleep can leave your circadian rhythm in disarray. \n\n**So, what if I miss sleep?**\nYour body is equipped to deal with missed sleep through a mechanism called your \"**sleep homeostat**.\" It determines how much sleep you need depending on factors such as how much sleep you've had (or missed) and how tired you are feeling. \n\nThe neat thing about this system is that if you do accumulate sleep debt, it doesn't make you repay on an hour-by-hour basis. This means that if you lose a couple of hours of sleep, your body will gradually make up for this loss over several nights, weeks, or even months. \n\n**Do I have to repay my sleep debt in full?** \nNo! Your body is more efficient than that. You only need to make up about 1/3 of the hours you've lost. You may also experience some deeper and more efficient sleep as you recover.\n\nSo, the best way to \"repay your sleep debt\" or catch up on missed sleep is to keep a consistent sleep schedule and maintain good sleep habits. In other words, trust your body and let your sleep homeostat do it's thing!\n\nTrying to catch up on missed sleep is a common mistake people make and can lead to an unhealthy sleep cycle and an irregular sleep system.\n","Top Image":"Appimage–170(2).jpg","JourneyCard":["rechmnPL3XmBGeQEB"],"JourneyCardIds":["rechmnPL3XmBGeQEB"],"id":"recvZ0M9XivmUKvUf"},"recvZn2ofiHISzy1k":{"Name":"Orientation 1.4","Bottom Body":"Great!

On a typical night, your body has around four **90 minute sleep cycles** where you spend time in each of the stages. \n\n**NREM Stages**\n**Stage 1 (N1): **This stage begins right after we fall asleep. It is usually less than 10 minutes and is a light sleep. During this time, it’s pretty easy to be woken up. Alpha and theta brain waves occur during this stage. \n**Stage 2 (N2): **Next we move into stage 2, which lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. During this time, our muscles become more relaxed, and our brains begin to have slow-wave brain activity characterized by theta, then delta brain waves.\n**Stage 3 (N3): **This deep sleep stage lasts about 20 to 40 minutes. We can have some body movement and there is an increase in delta waves. It gets harder to wake somebody up once they enter stage 3 sleep. \n\n**REM Sleep: **The next stage of sleep is REM sleep. This is when we do most of our dreaming. During REM sleep, our breathing becomes irregular, our eyelids flutter, and our brains paralyze our muscles, so we can’t act out our dreams. \n\nREM is characterized by beta and gamma brain waves, similar to when we are awake.

It lowers your overall quality of sleep, reduces REM, and can lead to frequent awakenings. Avoid drinking any alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime to minimize the impact. \n- **Nicotine:** Nicotine is a stimulant that can lead to fragmented sleep, reduced REM sleep and increased snoring and sleep apnea. Avoid it within 4 hours of bedtime. \n- **Allergy Medications:** Certain allergy medications contain stimulants and others (first-generation) can cause excessive drowsiness and disrupt your quality of sleep.

HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser User uses will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com.

Web beacons may be invisible to User, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Website, Mobile App and Services, to monitor how users navigate the Website, Mobile App and Services, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.\n\\- Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about User’s interactions with the Website, Mobile App and Services, such as the links User clicks on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto User’s Device from Rested’s web server and/or Mobile App or a third party service provider, is active only while User is connected to the Website and/or Mobile App, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n\\- ETag or Entity Tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.\nRested may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:\n\\- Strictly Necessary. Rested may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that Rested considers is strictly necessary to allow User to use and access Rested’s Website, Mobile App and Services, including cookies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, or to improve.\n\\- Performance Related.

Rested may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer User enhanced functionality when accessing the Website, including identifying User when User sign in to Rested’s Website or keeping track of User’s specified preferences, including in terms of the presentation of content on Rested’s Website.\nRested obtains User’s consent to Rested’s information storage or collection Tracking Technologies by providing User with transparent information in Rested’s Privacy Policy and providing User with the opportunity to make a choice to disable cookies as set forth above. Please note that Rested is not required to obtain User’s consent to the information collection Tracking Technologies identified above that is strictly necessary. User has the right to object to other use of information storage or collection technologies.\nThere may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by Rested in connection with the Website, Mobile App and Services. Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with Rested’s Website. Rested does not control those Tracking Technologies and Rested is not responsible for them. However, User consents to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of Rested’s Website, Mobile App and Services and accepts that Rested’s statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties. User should check Third Party Websites to confirm how User’s information is collected and used by them.\nVarious third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across Third Party Websites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently Rested does not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.\n1. **Information Third Parties Provide About User.**\nRested may, from time to time, supplement the information Rested collects directly from User at the Website, Mobile App and through Services with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance Rested’s ability to serve User, to tailor Rested’s content to User and to offer User opportunities that may be of interest to User. To the extent Rested combines any non-personally identifiable information Rested receives from those sources with User’s Personal Information Rested collect on the Website, Mobile App and Services, it will be treated as Personal Information and Rested will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless Rested has disclosed otherwise.\n1. **Interactions with Third-Party Websites.**\nThe Website, Mobile App and Services may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Website, Mobile App and Services and User’s account on a Third Party Website or Third Party Services. The use of this functionality may involve the third party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to Rested. For example, when User registers with the Website and/or Mobile App, User may have an option to use User’s Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Website, Mobile App and Services or otherwise link accounts. If Rested offers and User chooses to use this functionality to access Rested’s Website, Mobile App and Services, the Third Party Website or application may send Personal Information about User to the Website and/or Mobile App. If so, Rested will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since Rested is collecting it as a result of User’s accessing of and interaction on Rested’s Website, Mobile App and Services. In addition, Rested may provide Third Party Websites’ interfaces or links on the Website, Mobile App and Services to facilitate User’s sending a communication from the Website, Mobile App and Services. For example, Rested may use third parties to facilitate emails, text messages, blog postings, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to Rested’s Privacy Policy. Rested may not control or have access to User’s communications through these third parties. Further, when User use Third Party Websites or Third Party Services, User is using their services and not Rested’s Services and they, not Rested, are responsible for their practices. User should review the applicable third party privacy policies before using such third party tools on Rested’s Website.\n1. **How Rested Uses the Personal Information.**\nExcept as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by User, Rested will not disclose any information Rested gathers from User on Rested’s Website, Mobile App and Services. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Rested does not share User’s Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Rested may provide to third parties information about User that does not allow User to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of Rested’s Website, Mobile App and Services. For example, Rested might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit and/or use Rested’s Services, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of Rested’s Services, or the activities that users engage in while on Rested’s Website and/or Mobile App.\nIn connection with the Business Services, the Business Customer may disclose certain Personal Information to Rested. To the extent that Rested collects and processes Personal Information supplied by the Business Customer, Rested is considered to be the data controller for the purposes of European data protection legislation and Rested will process User’s Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nRested may use User’s information that Rested collects about User:\n\\- to contact User occasionally to inform User of new Services features, or news or articles Rested thinks will be of interest to User. Rested may send User regular updates on issues Rested thinks will be of interest to User;\n\\- to contact User with regard to User’s use of the Services and, in Rested’s discretion, changes to the Services and/or the service policies;\n\\- for internal business purposes;\n\\- for purposes disclosed at the time User provide User’s information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy;\n\\- to provide User with information or services or process transactions that User has requested or agreed to receive including to send User electronic newsletters;\n\\- to provide User with marketing materials or relevant advertising, promotions and recommendations from Rested or our business partners;\n\\- to enable User to participate in a variety of the Service features;\n\\- to process User’s account registration, including verifying User’s information is active and valid;\n\\- to identify User as the author of any comments that User sends to Rested to be posted on the Website or Mobile App;\n\\- to ensure that content on the Website and Mobile App is presented in the most effective manner for User and for User’s computer or mobile device;\n\\- to provide User with information relating to any events held by Rested, where User has consented to be contacted for such purposes; and\n\\- to provide User with access to User’s personal account.\nUser can always opt out of utilizing the Services, and accordingly opt out of Rested’s use of User’s Personal Information, by sending an email to support@rested.health.\n1. **How and When Does Rested Discloses Information to Third Parties.**\nRested may share User’s Personal Information, including performance measurement information associated with User’s name that is collected or generated at the Website, Mobile App or through the Services.\nPersonal Information may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for Rested for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which User has subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to User’s Personal Information in order to support Rested’s information technology or to handle mailings on Rested’s behalf. If Rested transfers User’s Personal Information to an outside agent or organization for such purpose, Rested will take appropriate measures in an effort to protect User’s privacy and the Personal Information that Rested transfers.\nRested may share your Personal Information with various business partners. Some of these business partners may use your Personal Information to facilitate the offering of services or products that may be of interest to you. We may also share your Personal Information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.\nRested may, in Rested’s sole discretion, share or transfer Personal Information where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process, to interact with anti-fraud databases, to protect User’s interests, to protect the security or integrity of Rested’s databases or the Website and the Mobile App, to enforce the Terms & Conditions or protect the business or reputation of Rested and/or its Business Customers, to take precautions against legal liability, to protect and defend the rights or property of Rested and/or its Business Customers, for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to User’s use of the Website, Mobile App and Services.\nRested reserves the right to disclose and transfer all Personal Information: (i) to an operator of the Website or Mobile App or applicable database provided such entity agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof to the extent applicable; or (ii) to a successor in interest of Rested in connection with a merger, consolidation, restructuring, change of control, the sale of substantially all of Rested’s interests and/or assets or other organizational change, including, during the course of any due diligence process, provided such successor entity agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof.\n1. **Information User Discloses Publicly or To Others.**\nRested or others may store, display, reproduce, publish, distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed) and may or may not attribute it to User. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in connection with any User Content that you provide. Be aware that public postings (including group messaging with other Users) are not confidential. Please note that Rested does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect User’s privacy or keep it secure. Rested is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that User makes publicly available through the Services, the Mobile App or Website, or for what others do with information User shares with them on the Mobile App and Website. Rested is not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that User discloses or receives from third parties through the Service.\n1. **Name and Likeness.**\nRested may also publish User’s name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information that is part of User Content, and Rested may use the User Content, or any portion of such User Content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities, provided that Rested will not exercise such rights as to any User Content which identifies User in a public manner unless User provides a separate consent to Rested in writing (email is sufficient) authorizing such use.

Profile information is used by Rested primarily to be presented back to and edited by User when User accesses the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. Rested may offer Users the ability to manage their public profile and use profile preference settings, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time to time, so Users should visit it frequently to confirm the settings reflect User’s then current preferences and Rested recommends that User does not post information or content as part of User’s profile that User is not prepared to make public. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to Rested’s operations and maintenance schedules. User should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, User should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, do not employ complex data security protection and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public User’s information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of User’s profile.\n1. **Use of Anonymous Information.**\nWe may use Anonymous Information (as defined below), or disclose it to Third Party Service providers, to provide and improve the Service.

If you fail to renew your subscription for any Services before its scheduled expiration date, the then-current non-promotional subscription rate will apply to any renewal.\n    3.
